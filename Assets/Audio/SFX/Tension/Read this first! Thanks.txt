Thanks for downloading my first pack of scary/tension effects. This pack contains 6 tracks (MP3 files), featuring a sampler/compilation of the tracks.

I hope this effects improve your game/video/demo. No need to give me credit or purchase a license to use these in your 

commercial game, but i'd love to know when and how you use these effects and be able to motivate myself to continue making music.

If you have any questions or would like to know more about my music and hire me to compose custom music, write me at: wardrumsbeats@gmail.com

Thanks again, peace.
